            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages 
                — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. 
                This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like,
                 and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.</p>
                 <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.

                    For example, you can decide to have the main heading on your page to be shown as large red text.
                     The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:</p>
                     <code>h1 {
                        color: red;
                        font-size: 5em;
                      }</code>
                      <p>Here are some quick elements in CSS!</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Border: 5px;</li>
                        <li>Color: Green;</li>
                        <li>Display: Flex;</li>
                        <li>Align-Text: Center;</li>
                        <li>Background-Color: Blue;</li>
                      </ul>

            <h1>What Is A Selector?</h1>
            <p>A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected
                 to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.
                 The element or elements which are selected by the selector are referred to as the subject of the selector.</p>
                 <code><i>h1</i> {
                    color: blue;
                  }
                  </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Advanced_Selectors">
            <header>Advanced Selectors</header>
            <h1>What Are Advanced Selectors?</h1>
            <p>If you have more than one thing which uses the same CSS 
                then the individual selectors can be combined into a selector list so that the rule is applied to all of the individual selectors.
                 For example, if I have the same CSS for an h1 and also a class of .special, I could write this as two separate rules.</p>
                 <code>h1 {
                    color: blue;
                  }
                  
                  .special {
                    color: blue;
                  }</code>
                  <p>I could also combine these into a selector list, by adding a comma between them.</p>
                  <code>h1, .special {
                    color: blue;
                  }</code>

            <h1>Debugging CSS</h1>
            <p>Sometimes when writing CSS you will encounter an issue where your CSS doesn't seem to be doing what you expect.
                 Perhaps you believe that a certain selector should match an element, but nothing happens, or a box is a different size than you expected.
                  Use the DevTools included in all modern browsers
                   can help you to find out what is going on.</p>

        <h1>Organizing your CSS</h1>
        <p>As you start to work on larger stylesheets and big projects you will discover that maintaining a huge CSS file can be challenging.
             In this article we will take a brief look at some best practices for writing your CSS to make it easily maintainable,
              and some of the solutions you will find in use by others to help improve maintainability.</p>
              <p>If you get to set the rules for the project or are working alone, then the most important thing to do is to keep things consistent.
                 Consistency can be applied in all sorts of ways,
                  such as using the same naming conventions for classes, choosing one method of describing color, or maintaining consistent formatting.
                 (For example, will you use tabs or spaces to indent your code? If spaces, how many spaces?)</p>
                 <p>There are a couple of ways you will see CSS formatted. Some developers put all of the rules onto a single line, like so:</p>
                 <code>.box {background-color: #567895; }
                    h2 {background-color: black; color: white; }</code>
                    <p>Hope you enjoyed these tips!</p>
